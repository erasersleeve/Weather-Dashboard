## Weather Dashboard
The weather dashboard is a simple weather monitor that searches local current weather and 5 weather forecasts via user input. The dashboard uses openweather api to search for general weather data by city name, and longitude and latitude data via the opencage geocacher api to gather the UV index. Searches are saved, displayed, and clickable.
